# Familiarize

### Overview
Fam me. 

### Development Workflow
* assigned features should be pushed to separate branches
  * Branch naming convention: `<your-name>/<feature-name>`
* upon good progress of your feature that works to some extent, submit a pull request to `master`
!
### Git Basics

ALWAYS do this before you start coding so that there are no merge conflicts:
```
git pull origin master
```

For creating branch and for FIRST push to remote branch.
```
git checkout -b <your-name>/<feature-name>
git add <files you want to include>
git commit -m "some commit msg"
git push -u origin <your-name>/<feature-name>
```

For adding files to branch, and pushing changes to your remote branch. (Note difference in 'git push')
```
git add <files you want to include>
git commit -m "some commit msg"
git push
```
